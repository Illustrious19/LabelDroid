this tutorial we're going to be learning about something called adapter classes
what an adapter class does is it already implements an interface and it overrides
now in the last tutorial when we implemented from the interface like
override all of those seven time-consuming methods like we did
it with a method body that is pretty much a blank body or pretty much a body
that's going to appear in your status bar so now we can go ahead build our
might as well next we can go ahead and build our status bar which is the only
to put string in details and what this program is going to do is it's pretty
that does nothing any we're saying all right what's the point of that well in
rest whenever you do them they just don't do anything at all just like we
the methods that you need so it's pretty cool in the sense that you don't have to
that way when you inherit from an adapter class you only have to override
much just going to say how many times arm well you'll see what it does but
variables the status bar in the details is pretty much going to be the text
you should always have a title get that their real name it tootle I mean why not
here and the first thing they're both going to be private variables I'm going
want your program to detect all of those different methods sometimes you only
Mouse listener and Mouse motion listener we had to implement seven different
methods and those are kind of time consuming in sometimes you don't always
kind of save you some time they made something called an adapter class and
want your programming to be able to tell when a user click something instead of
put status bar or whatever you named it last time and now we got two private
parameters and for the body let's go ahead and add a title super title since
going to make two variables for our program again get all your imports right
before you only have to override the ones that you're going to use in the
pretty much this details is going to tell what's going to be displayed in the
drag release move you only need one of those so what Java did is in order to
what is going on guys welcome to your seventy seventh Java tutorial and in
status bar so that's all you need to know for now private J label and just
constructor which is like gooey it's not going to take any
thing we're really going to want up here in the window so wow I really miss that
wanted them to so let me go ahead and show you guys what I'm talking about

*Dataset can be download at <https://drive.google.com/open?id=18BV1oDsvEVY1xvefLe0QpGBPgpvNGY43>*

## Data Preprocessing

The list of meaningless labels can be seen at [Data_preprocessing/missing_label.txt](./Data_preprocessing/meaningless_label.txt)

## Evaluation
We evaluate our model in three aspects, i.e., accuracy with
automated testing, generality and usefulness with user study. We
also shows the practical value of LabelDroid by submitting the
labels to app development teams.
